## 🧮 How It Works  

### 📐 Calculation Algorithm  

The app employs an iterative approach to calculate square roots:  
1. Initialize `subnum = 1`.  
2. Repeatedly subtract `subnum` from the input number.  
3. Increment `subnum` by 2 after each subtraction.  
4. Count iterations until the input reaches 0 or becomes negative.  

**Example for input `16`:**  
- Iteration 1: 16 - 1 = 15  
- Iteration 2: 15 - 3 = 12  
- Iteration 3: 12 - 5 = 7  
- Iteration 4: 7 - 7 = 0  
- **Result**: Square root of 16 is 4.
